Examples of Usage
-----------------

1. Rename files example.txt and test.txt to 1.txt and 2.txt:

   $ seqren example.txt test.txt

2. Rename all files with extension .jpg in the current directory
   in a sequence (1.jpg, 2.jpg ...)

   $ seqren *.jpg

3. Rename all files with extension .jpg in the current directory
   in a sequence starting in number 0 (0.jpg, 1.jpg, ...)

   $ seqren *.jpg -s 0

4. Rename all files with extension .jpg in the current directory
   in a sequence, with 2 digit numbers with leading zeroes
   (01.jpg, 02.jpg, ...)

   $ seqren *.jpg -z 2

5. Rename all files with extension .jpg in the current directory
   in a sequence, with 2 digit numbers and starting with the text
   "Day At The Beach-" (Day At The Beach-01.jpg,
   Day At The Beach-02.jpg, ...)

   $ seqren *.jpg -z 2 -T "Day At The Beach-"

6. Same as previous example but changing extension to .jpeg
   (Day At The Beach-01.jpeg, Day At The Beach-02.jpeg, ...)

   $ seqren *.jpg -z 2 -T "Day At The Beach-" -e .jpeg

7. Rename all files with extension .mp3 in a sequence, keeping
   the original name after the number separated by a space
   (1 House of the Rising Sun.mp3, 2 Scarborough Fair.mp3, ...):

   $ seqren *.mp3 -i -t " "

8. Same as previous example but moving the files to the directory
   "Folk Music" (Folk Music/1 House of the Rising Sun.mp3,
   Folk Music/2 Scarborough Fair.mp3, ...):

   $ seqren *.mp3 -i -t " " -d "Folk Music"

9. Add option -k to keep the original files:

   $ seqren *.mp3 -k -i -t " " -d "Folk Music"

10. Option -n only shows the operations to execute, without actually
    renaming the files. Example:

   $ seqren *.mp3 -n -k -i -t " " -d "Folk Music"

   would output:

   cp House of the Rising Sun.mp3 Folk Music/1 House of the Rising Sun.mp3
   cp Scarboroug Fair.mp3 Folk Music/2 Scarborough Fair.mp3
