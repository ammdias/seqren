Installation
------------

The following instructions describe the installation process for basic usage by
a single user in a Linux environment.  They probably apply to other Unix-like
operating systems but this was *not* tested -- use it at your own risk.  It may
also be possible to use this program in MS Windows but, as with any other
command-line utility, it will require some tweaking by the user.

For more advanced instructions, please refer to the user manual in the files
"MANUAL" or "MANUAL.html".

1. Uncompress the program zip file to a convenient place and open a terminal
   on that directory.  Execute the local installation script:

        $ bash local_install.sh

   This will copy the program to the current user's "~/.local/lib" hidden
   directory and create a symbolic link to the program in  "~/.local/bin", which
   should be in the user's PATH.

2. To check that the program is working, open *another* terminal and type:

        $ seqren --version

   This should print the program's name and version.  If not, check if the
   directory "~/.local/bin/" is in the PATH:

        $ echo $PATH

   Also, check that the program was copied to the location mentioned above
   and that the symbolic link was created.


Examples of Usage
-----------------

1. Rename files `example.txt` and `test.txt` to `1.txt` and `2.txt`:

       $ seqren example.txt test.txt

2. Rename all files with extension `.jpg` in the current directory
   in a sequence (`1.jpg`, `2.jpg` ...)

       $ seqren *.jpg

3. Rename all files with extension `.jpg` in the current directory
   in a sequence starting in number 0 (`0.jpg`, `1.jpg`, ...)

       $ seqren *.jpg -s 0

4. Rename all files with extension `.jpg` in the current directory
   in a sequence, with 2 digit numbers with leading zeroes
   (`01.jpg`, `02.jpg`, ...)

       $ seqren *.jpg -z 2

5. Rename all files with extension .jpg in the current directory
   in a sequence, with 2 digit numbers and starting with the text
   "Day At The Beach-" (`Day At The Beach-01.jpg`,
   `Day At The Beach-02.jpg`, ...)

       $ seqren *.jpg -z 2 -T "Day At The Beach-"

6. Same as previous example but changing extension to `.jpeg`
   (`Day At The Beach-01.jpeg`, `Day At The Beach-02.jpeg`, ...)

       $ seqren *.jpg -z 2 -T "Day At The Beach-" -e .jpeg

7. Rename all files with extension `.mp3` in a sequence, keeping
   the original name after the number separated by a space
   (`1 House of the Rising Sun.mp3`, `2 Scarborough Fair.mp3`, ...):

       $ seqren *.mp3 -i -t " "

8. Same as previous example but moving the files to the directory
   "Folk Music" (`Folk Music/1 House of the Rising Sun.mp3`,
   `Folk Music/2 Scarborough Fair.mp3`, ...):

       $ seqren *.mp3 -i -t " " -d "Folk Music"

9. Add option `-k` to keep the original files:

       $ seqren *.mp3 -k -i -t " " -d "Folk Music"

10. Option `-n` only shows the operations to execute, without actually
    renaming the files. Example:

       $ seqren *.mp3 -n -k -i -t " " -d "Folk Music"

   would output:

       cp House of the Rising Sun.mp3 Folk Music/1 House of the Rising Sun.mp3
       cp Scarborough Fair.mp3 Folk Music/2 Scarborough Fair.mp3
