INSTALLATION
------------

The instructions below are for installation on a modern Linux system.  They
may work on other modern Unix-like systems like BSD derivatives, including
MacOS, but that has not been tested and may require some tweaking.  Try it at
your own risk.  For MS Windows installation, the user will have to do some
tweaking.

1. Download and unzip the program's compressed file in a directory of your
   choosing.

2. Open a terminal in the directory where the program was uncompressed and run
   one of the following scripts to install locally or globally:

   * Local installation:

         $ bash local_install.sh

     This will install the program for the current user only and is suited for
     single-user systems.  The program will be installed in a directory under
     `$HOME/.local/lib` and a symbolic link `$HOME/.local/bin/seqren` will be
     created to allow simple execution.

     On most Linux systems the `$HOME/.local/bin` directory will be inserted in
     the execution PATH, if it exists.  If that is not your case, you must make
     sure to insert it.

   * Global installation:

         $ sudo bash global_install.sh

     This will install the program for all the system's users and should be the
     option if it is installed in a multi-user system.  The program will be
     installed under `/usr/local/lib` and a symlink `/usr/local/bin/seqren` will
     be created.

   * Manual installation:

     Copy the uncompressed program directory to a location of your choosing and
     create a symbolic link `seqren` to the launch program (`seqren.py`) anywhere
     in your PATH.

3. Test that the installation was successful with the command:

       $ seqren --version

   (this should open the print the program's name and version)

       $ seqren --help

   (this should print the program's simple help page)


USAGE
-----

This utility is to be used from the command line (terminal), as any other shell
command.  The basic usage is:

    $ seqren [file [file ...]

which will rename the file(s) passed as arguments to a numerical sequence,
preserving their extensions.  It's also possible to change the final name (and
extension) of the renamed files using one or more of the optional arguments,
like preserving the file's original names, in addition to the sequence number,
inserting text before of after the number or changing the file's extensions.

The files could be passed explicitly or by globbing using the usual shell
wildcards, like:

    $ seqren *.jpg
    $ seqren IMG-202102??-*.jpg

The sequence will usually start at the number 1, with no leading zeroes, but
this behaviour may be altered with the `--start` and `--leading_zeroes`
options.  It is also possible to move the files while renaming them and to
keep the original files.

You may combine several options.  Check the [REFERENCE] section for the
explanation of the full capabilities of the utility.

REFERENCE
---------

### Options to change the sequence number

* `-s <number>`, `--start <number>`: change the starting number of the sequence.
  The sequence will start at the number passed as argument and increase by 1 at
  each renamed file (reverse sequencing or other step increases is not
  possible). Example:

      $ seqren -s 10 *.jpg

  will rename all files with `.jpg` extension in the current directory,
  starting at number 10: `10.jpg`, `11.jpg`, etc.

* `-z <number>`, `--leading_zeroes <number>`: format the sequence number to a
  fixed width, adding the necessary leading zeroes.

      $ seqren -z 3 *.jpg

  will rename all files with `.jpg` extension in the current directory with
  three-digit numbers with leading zeroes: `001.jpg`, `002.jpg`, etc.

### Options to insert other text besides the sequence number

* `-t <text>`, `--text_after <text>`: insert the text passed as argument after
  the sequence number.

      $ seqren -t '-Rome' *.jpg

  will rename all `.jpg` files in the current directory, inserting the text
  `-Rome` after the number: `1-Rome.jpg`, `2-Rome.jpg`, etc.

* `-T <text>`, `--text_before <text>`: insert the text passed as argument
  before the sequence number.

      $ seqren -T 'Rome-' *.jpg

  will rename all `.jpg` files in the current directory, inserting the text
  `-Rome` before the number: `Rome-1.jpg`, `Rome-2.jpg`, etc.

* `-i`, `--include_name_after`: insert the original file name after the
  sequence number.

      $ seqren -i -t '-' MammaMia.mp3 NovemberRain.mp3

  will rename the files passed as argument, inserting their original name after
  the sequence number (also note the dash inserted by option `-t`):
  `1-MammaMia.mp3`, `2-NovemberRain.mp3`

* `-I`, `--include_name_before`: insert the original file name before the
  sequence number.

      $ seqren -I -T '-' MammaMia.mp3 NovemberRain.mp3

  will rename the files passed as argument, inserting their original name
  before the sequence number (also note the dash inserted by option `-T`):
  `MammaMia-1.mp3`, `NovemberRain-2.mp3`

### Options to change the default renaming behaviour of the program

* `-e <extension>`, `--extension <extension>`: change extension of renamed
  files to the passed argument.

      $ seqren -e .jpeg *.jpg *.JPG

  will rename all files with extensions `.jpg` and `.JPG`, change their
  extension to `.jpeg`: `1.jpeg`, `2.jpeg`, etc.

* `-k`, `--keep`: will keep the original files, making new renamed copies of
  them.

* `-d <directory>`, `--destination_directory <directory>`: will move (or copy,
  if the `-k` option was added) the renamed files to the directory passed as
  argument.

* `-n`, `--no_act`: will print the actions that would be performed by the
  program instead of actually executing them.  This is extremely useful to
  check the changes that will be made by all the options before submitting
  them.

### Miscellaneous options

* `-h`, `--help`: display the program's help page

* `--version`: display the program's name and version.

* `--copyright`: display the program's copyright information.

* `--manual`: display the user's manual in a web browser window.
